          <li>git add -A: adds the changed files in our working directory to the staging area of Git</li>
          <li>git commit -m "added code to HTML file": commits the changes and adds a short message about the changes we implemented</li>
          <li>git pull origin main: it is good habit to always pull the base branch into your feature branch before pushing up any code -you should see a message in your terminal saying something like "already up to date"</li>
          <li>git push origin feature/add-html: pushes up all of our changes that we made in the new branch</li>
          <li>Next, navigate to the appropriate repository on GitHub. This is where we will merge our feature branch into the base branch</li>
          <li>Once in the repository, navigate to the desired branchand click the "pull requests" tab at the top</li>
          <li>Click the "new pull request" button. Give the PR a title and a short description, then click the "create pull request button"</li>
          <li>Click the "merge pull request" button and confirm</li>
          <li>Navigate back to the main branch in GitHub and you should see your file is now there</li>
          <li>Next, go back to the terminal and enter the command git checkout main. Then enter the command git pull origin main. This updates our local reo with the new merged-in feature</li>
          <li>Next we want to close our issue on GitHub since we have merged in our feature. Navigate to the "issues" tab, select that issue, and click the "close issue" button</li>
