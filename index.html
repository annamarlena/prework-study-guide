        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown</li>
          <li>The header element appears at the top of the page and usually contains the navigation menu and introductory content</li>
          <li>The paragraph element represents a block of text</li>
          <li>The section element defines a section in the document and allows us to elegantly organize the content of a page</li>
          <li>The image element contains information about images that are displayed on the webpage</li>
          <li>The footer element appears at the bottom of the page and usually contains the author, copyright, contact, sitemap, and navigation</li>

      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>There are 3 ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet</li>
          <li>Inline CSS: applied to a specific HTML tag and styles one particular page element only</li>
          <li>Internal style sheet: embedded directly into the head section of an HTML file. These CSS rules apply only to that page</li>
          <li>External style sheet: the most common and preferred way. Allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, making design changes easier</li>
          <li>Separation of concerns: widely used term based on the idea that each section of code should have its own responsibility. Code is separated into different files based on use</li>
          <li>A largin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element</li>
          <li>A period preceding a class name designates it as a class selector. Any HTML element assigned to that class will gain these properties</li>
        </ul>

      <section class="card" id="git-section">
        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout main: switches to the branch called main</li>
          <li>git pull origin main: pulls down the latest main branch</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>git add -A: adds the changed files in our working directory to the staging area of Git</li>
          <li>git commit -m "added code to HTML file": commits the changes and adds a short message about the changes we implemented</li>
          <li>git pull origin main: it is good habit to always pull the base branch into your feature branch before pushing up any code -you should see a message in your terminal saying something like "already up to date"</li>
          <li>git push origin feature/add-html: pushes up all of our changes that we made in the new branch</li>
          <li>Next, navigate to the appropriate repository on GitHub. This is where we will merge our feature branch into the base branch</li>
          <li>Once in the repository, navigate to the desired branchand click the "pull requests" tab at the top</li>
          <li>Click the "new pull request" button. Give the PR a title and a short description, then click the "create pull request button"</li>
          <li>Click the "merge pull request" button and confirm</li>
          <li>Navigate back to the main branch in GitHub and you should see your file is now there</li>
          <li>Next, go back to the terminal and enter the command git checkout main. Then enter the command git pull origin main. This updates our local reo with the new merged-in feature</li>
          <li>Next we want to close our issue on GitHub since we have merged in our feature. Navigate to the "issues" tab, select that issue, and click the "close issue" button</li>

      <section class="card" id="javascript-section">
        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Variables are containers that store values. You declare a variable with the "let" keyword</li>
          <li>A semicolon at the end of a line indicates where a statement ends. It's only required when you need to separate statements on a single line</li>
          <li>After declaring a variable, you can give it a value</li>
          <li>You retrieve the variable by calling the variable name. You can change the assigned value of a variable later in the code</li>
          <li>Variable data types: strings, numbers, boolean aka true/false, arrays, and object</li> 
          <li>Functions are a way of packaging functionality that you wish to reuse</li>
          <li>Conditionals are code structures used to test if an expression returns true or false</li>
          <li>An operator is a mathematical symbol that produces a result based on two values or variables</li>
          <li>The return statement tells the browser to return the result</li>
          <li>Events are code structures that listen for an activity in the browser and run code in response. An example is the click event</li>
