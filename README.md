# Boot Camp Prework Study Guide for Students

## Description

This study guide was created for boot camp students who are going through the prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

- My main motivation in completing this was to have a brief refresher on coding prior to beginning the boot camp classes 
- Although it was assigned as prework for the program, it served the desired purpose of refreshing my basic coding skills
- Additional learning included some debugging of the JavaScript, and incorporating the math.floor and math.random built-in JS functions
